# CenterViewPager

When I try to replace the gallery widget which display images on the horizontal center using ViewPager. I encounter a problem: with normal Viewpager provided by android support v4, images item won't show right on the horizontal center, instead always on Left. So I customized the ViewPager based on the source code.

You can install the Demo.apk on the root directory to see the final performance.

# How to use:
you can just copy the CenterViewPager file to your specific "View" folder in your project. Then use it like the normal ViewPager.
